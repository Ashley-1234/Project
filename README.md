Simple Calculator in Python

This is a basic calculator application written in Python. It performs **fundamental arithmetic operations** such as:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

The program features a simple **text-based interface** that allows users to enter numbers and choose the operation they want to perform.

Features

* Menu-based operation selection
* Handles invalid inputs
* Division by zero check
* Clean and readable code
* Easy to extend with more features

How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the code in a file named `calculator.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5. Run the script using:

```bash
python calculator.py
```
